# Notes
plan of action:

1. study the example gif and create an html framework that is more or less the same.
2. style the html framework with style.css to structer and stack everything correctly.
3. add questions and functions in js file to make quiz functional. using card classes, container classes as well as multiple ids and 'on click' events.

# Code Quiz

As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
