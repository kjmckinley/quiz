## Notes
plan of action:

1. study the example gif and create an html framework that is more or less the same.
2. style the html framework with style.css to structer and stack everything correctly.
3. add questions, functions and a timer in js file to make quiz functional. using multiple ids, classes and 'on click' events.

**Play with the idea of being more organized by adding additional html and js files in order to separate the quiz and the high score features.

**Develope with multiple branches for the same reason.

**try and create multiple questions that are randomized each time.
